Paley graph drawer
==================

A paley graph is a type of aesthetically pleasing, highly symmetric graph.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paley_graph for definition and some basic properties.

My ultimate goal is to make this into a web app, but I currently don't have time.  Until then, enjoy the Turtles!
