Paley graph drawer
==================

A Paley graph is a type of aesthetically pleasing, highly symmetric graph.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paley_graph for definition and some basic properties.

This repo provides simple scripts to draw Paley graphs in Python (using Turtles), PostsScript, and HTML/JavaScript (using HTML 5 canvases).
